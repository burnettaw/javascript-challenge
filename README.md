For all my javascript projects


Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search


Creates a basic HTML web page.


Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, the code appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Shows column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.

Uses a date form in with JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.



Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

Completes all of Level 1 criteria.

Uses multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, writes JavaScript code for user to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape
